    <h1> Murrey</h1>
    <p> 
        Have you ever let your idea of sex get ahead of what the reality is? I have.
        Maybe it wasn't even the idea of it, just something I had to do. He did have beautiful murrey colored paneling on his walls.
        Is wood panelling the ultimate end in sexual satisfaction.
        Why does my life revolve around sex so much?
        Why do I want someone to hurt and degrade me, and then why do I act surprised that being hurt is painful.
